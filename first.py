Itâ€™s essential to stay calm and take immediate steps to manage your condition until you can see a doctor. Here are some things you can do:\n

Relax: Try to stay calm and take deep breaths. Stress can increase blood pressure.\n


Avoid Stimulants: Stay away from caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, as these can raise your blood pressure.\n

Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to help maintain healthy blood pressure levels.\n

Monitor Your Blood Pressure: If you have a blood pressure monitor, keep track of your readings.\n

Eat Healthily: Focus on fruits, vegetables, and low-sodium foods. Avoid processed foods and excess salt.\n

Rest: Take breaks and avoid heavy physical activity.\n

Seek Medical Attention if Necessary: If you experience symptoms like chest pain, severe headache, dizziness, or shortness of breath, seek immediate medical help.
